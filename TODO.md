# Enterprise & Advanced MLM Features Roadmap

## 1. Advanced Game Mechanics & Retention (Priority)
These features are designed to increase user addiction, retention, and immediate action.

- [ ] **Smart "Profit Max" Balancing (Visual Strategy Widget)**
    - *Concept*: A dashboard widget that calculates exactly how much PV is needed in which leg to trigger the next commission cycle.
    - *Goal*: Gamifies the "Placement" decision.
    - *Visual*: "Place next recruit LEFT to earn $50!"

- [ ] **"Road to Diamond" Progress Bar (Gamified Rank)**
    - *Concept*: Visual progress bars showing exactly what is missing for the next rank (e.g., "Need 2 more Personal Recruits & 500 PV").
    - *Goal*: Uses "Goal Gradient Effect" to push users to finish the level.

- [ ] **"Unclaimed Commission" FOMO Alerts**
    - *Concept*: Notifications highlighting lost earnings due to inactivity.
    - *Ex*: "You missed $50 binary commission because you are not Active. Buy a product now!"

- [ ] **"The Hype Ticker" (Social Proof)**
    - *Concept*: Live scrolling ticker at the top of the dashboard.

## 2. Advanced Genealogy Tools
- [ ] **Genealogy "Matrix" & "List" Views**

    - *Matrix View*: Compact view to see depth and structure without scrolling.
    - *Goal*: Gives leaders the data tools they need to manage large organizations.

## 3. Financial Infrastructure (Critical Foundation)
